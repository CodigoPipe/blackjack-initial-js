Hi, here im gonna show you how the code works

i create two classes, cards and player, cards has a name and a value and player has name and points initialized in 0

then i create a few methods in order to play the game, the game will ask for your name to instanciate the player
then will give you two cards and the sum of the values, if it is between 18 and 21 you won
if it is below 18 the game ask you if you want another card an so on until you win or pass 21

the points of the player sum 1000 for each victory
